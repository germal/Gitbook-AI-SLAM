# 2018-Monocular Object and Plane SLAM in Structured Environments

## Abstract

We present a monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using high level object and plane landmarks, in addition to points. The resulting map is denser, more compact and meaningful compared to point only SLAM. We first propose a high order graphical model to jointly infer the 3D object and layout planes from single image considering occlusions and semantic constraints. The extracted cuboid object and layout planes are further optimized in a unified SLAM framework. Objects and planes can provide more semantic constraints such as Manhattan and object supporting relationships compared to points. Experiments on various public and collected datasets including ICL NUIM and TUM mono show that our algorithm can improve camera localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art SLAM and also generate dense maps in many structured environments.

除了点之外，我们还使用高级对象和平面地标呈现单眼同时定位和映射（SLAM）。与仅有点SLAM相比，生成的地图更密集，更紧凑，更有意义。我们首先提出一个高阶图形模型，以考虑遮挡和语义约束从单个图像联合推断3D对象和布局平面。提取的立方体对象和布局平面在统一的SLAM框架中进一步优化。与点相比，对象和平面可以提供更多的语义约束，例如曼哈顿和对象支持关系。各种公共和收集的数据集（包括ICL NUIM和TUM mono）的实验表明，与最先进的SLAM相比，我们的算法可以提高相机定位精度，并且还可以在许多结构化环境中生成密集地图。
