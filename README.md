* Introduction

> From Oct 2005 to August 2009 I was a post-doctoral research assistant in the Active Vision Group of the Oxford University Engineering Department. I worked under the supervision of Prof. David Murray.
>
> I was formerly a PhD student at the Machine Intelligence Laboratory of the Cambridge University Engineering Department, under the supervision of Dr. Tom Drummond. Originally from Austria, I matriculated at King's College, Cambridge in 1997 and obtained an MEng degree in 2001 and a PhD in 2006.
