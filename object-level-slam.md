- Abstract

  Mapping and self-localization in unknown envi-
  ronments are fundamental capabilities in many robotic applica-
  tions. These tasks typically involve the identification of objects
  as unique features or landmarks, which requires the objects
  both to be detected and then assigned a unique identifier that
  can be maintained when viewed from different perspectives
  and in different images. The data association and simultaneous
  localization and mapping (SLAM) problems are, individually,
  well-studied in the literature. But these two problems are in-
  herently tightly coupled, and that has not been well-addressed.
  Without accurate SLAM, possible data associations are com-
  binatorial and become intractable easily. Without accurate
  data association, the error of SLAM algorithms diverge easily.
  This paper proposes a novel nonparametric pose graph that
  models data association and SLAM in a single framework. An
  algorithm is further introduced to alternate between inferring
  data association and performing SLAM. Experimental results
  show that our approach has the new capability of associating
  object detections and localizing objects at the same time, leading
  to significantly better performance on both the data association
  and SLAM problems than achieved by considering only one and
  ignoring imperfections in the other
